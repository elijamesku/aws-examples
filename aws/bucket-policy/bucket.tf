 1. Set your Homebrew directory
export HOMEBREW_PREFIX="$HOME/homebrew"


(You can also add this to your .zshrc later.)

 2. Clone Homebrew into your home folder
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew "$HOMEBREW_PREFIX"


This clones the actual Homebrew core scripts â€” same as the installer would do.

 3. Add Homebrew to your PATH

Add this to your ~/.zshrc:

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

 4. Verify it's working
brew --version


You should see something like:

Homebrew 4.x.x

5. Try installing a package
